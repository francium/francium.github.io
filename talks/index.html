<ul>
<li>It is import to step away and think throughly and deeply about what the problem
trying to be solved is and how to best solve it</li>
<li>By thinking deeply you allow yourself to propose new solutions to the problem and
see difference ways to solve it</li>
<li>Take advantage of subconscious thought processes and the brain&rsquo;s ability to
generate ideas during rest and sleep</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Simplicity is not about you and simplicity is hard work. It is actually work to do
the job of simplifying things, but there&rsquo;s a huge payoff; The person who has
a genuinely simpler system, a system made out of genuinely simple parts is
going to be able to affect greater change with the least work. He&rsquo;s going to kick
your ass, right, he&rsquo;s never going to &lsquo;gem install a hairball&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s going to
spend more time simplifying things up front and in the long haul he&rsquo;s going to
wipe the plate with your because he - or she - because they&rsquo;ll have the ability to
change things when you&rsquo;re struggling to push elephants around</p>

<ul>
<li>An overview of Scrum, Agile, OO (class based and actual object based), software
development practices, where things have been misconstrued, mis interpreted and
ideally how things were originally intended to be utilitized</li>
<li>Software development relies too much on tools and not enough on the interaction of
customers, developers and software systems</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>TDD is overused and excessively applied to trying to test single units of software</li>
<li>Results in many tests that are not essential and creates additional code that will
need to be managed and require additional resources</li>
<li>Alternative ways of testing are proposed and the emphasis is not relying only on
unit test to assert correct software</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="functional-architecture-the-pits-of-success-mark-seemann-https-www-youtube-com-watch-v-us8qg9i1xw0"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US8QG9I1XW0">Functional architecture - The pits of success - Mark Seemann</a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Overview and examples of how functional programming principles can be applied to
create elegant solutions to problems in application development</li>
<li>Key points are:

<ul>
<li>Ports and adapters</li>
<li>Services, entities, value objects</li>
<li>Testability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gives insight into how the Onion/Hexagonal architecture can be created in a natural
way in functional programming and the end result is a system that is stable in
terms of refactoring and maintainability because pure functions are composed in a
way that anything unpure has to be relegated to the edges for everything to work &ndash;
leading to better maintainability</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Somewhat of a continuation of Seemann&rsquo;s &lsquo;Function architecture - The pits of
success&rsquo; talk</li>
<li>Focus is a bit more on how DI is used in OOP languages and how best to approach FP
when coming from that mindset</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Overview of a few major design patterns common in functional programming: functors,
applicatives, and monads</li>
<li>Lots of examples in F# and Haskell, as well as comparable implementation in OOP
languages (C#)</li>
<li>Good introduction to applying functional programming to design larger blocks of
code that fit well together and simplify many common procedures in a sane manner</li>
</ul>
