      <description>Elm incorporates some of the advances from the last 40 years of programming design without learning academic jargon Many pain points of frontend development don&amp;rsquo;t exist in Elm - nulls, undefined is not a function - and runtime exceptions are extremely rare Static typing, compile time checks, friendly error messages, type signature inference Some experience Elm programmers will start a program by sketching out the type signatures first to get a high-level view of what the various APIs will be, organization will look like and create a specification for the code.</description>

      <description>The concepts discussed here are not Raspberry Pi specific and can easily be adapted for other uses.  Background I have a Raspberry Pi setup with an external hard drive that is accessible over Samba. It&amp;rsquo;s be quite reliable so far, but I wanted to backup the data to another external drive hooked up to the same Raspberry Pi.
I found a simple solution to this problem using Rsync and Systemd timers (as opposed to installing Cron and learning Cron, but if you wish, you can substitute Systemd with Cron).</description>

      <description>There is a web client available, but still requires a connect to the VPN. See CAS wiki[ref 1] for more information.  Using openconnect Install openconenct
openconnect sslvpn.mcmaster.ca (try with sudo if it fails)
If nothing failed, you should be connected
Tested on Xubuntu and Debian (x86_64).
Download the VPN client for linux, *.tar.gz from https://www.mcmaster.ca/uts/network/vpn/
Download the VMWare Horizon client, *bundle from https://www.vmware.com/go/viewclients
cd to the location of both downloads</description>
