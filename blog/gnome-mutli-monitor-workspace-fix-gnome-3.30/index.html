                <p><code>workspaces_only_on_primary</code> setting is suppose to make workspaces work correctly [1] in a
multi-monitor setup.</p>

<p>There are older articles on the internet about enabling this option, but they won&rsquo;t work
with newer versions of GNOME. Prior to 3.30, I was using a very similar command which was
described by <a href="http://gregcor.com/2011/05/07/fix-dual-monitors-in-gnome-3-aka-my-workspaces-are-broken/">Greg Cordts in his post on the
subject</a>.</p>

<p>After upgrading to GNOME 3.30, this way of enabling the option stopped working.
After <a href="http://gregcor.com/2011/05/07/fix-dual-monitors-in-gnome-3-aka-my-workspaces-are-broken/">reporting this to the GNOME team as a bug</a>, two individuals provided some very useful
information,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The new way of enabling this option is,</p>

<pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.mutter workspaces-only-on-primary false
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>The Gnome Tweaks tool provides an option to enable this in the Workspaces tab</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>[1] Correctly means the workspace extends across all monitors and changing workspace
changes to the same workspace on all monitors. I don&rsquo;t know why this is not enabled by
default.</p>
