<h3 id="andy-wier-the-martian">Andy Wier, <em>The Martian</em></h3>

<p>2018-02-14</p>

<p>One of the reasons I really enjoyed this book was the period in which it took place &ndash;
modern times. Not some far of hypothetical future with faster-than-light travel or in
some futuristic distopian Earth. The story doesn&rsquo;t try to imagine anything beyond what
modern science and technology are capable of producing &ndash; well that part is generously
sped up a few decades or so &ndash; and the situations in which the POV character finds
himself are situations you would expect an astronaut to be in. After all, when you think
of an astronaut you think of a person in a bulky white suit doing crazy science
experiments in zero gravity. Well that&rsquo;s exactly the type of story Wier has created.</p>

<p>Humans land on mars, do some science, the <em>Martian dust</em> hits the fan, and decide to go
back home while they still physically able too. Minus one astronaut who dies on his way
to the spaceship.</p>

<p>Well it turns out that one astronaut didn&rsquo;t die. So he decides to camp out on Mars for a
while &ndash; at least until his food runs out. And he does some crazy science, primarily
involving biology&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a story of science and adventure. It&rsquo;s told very well and with minimal advances in
science and technology. If you&rsquo;re looking for a Sci-Fi story without crazy, alternative,
hypothetical future science things, then it&rsquo;s a fantastic read.</p>

<h3 id="scalzi-old-man-s-war">Scalzi, <em>Old Man&rsquo;s War</em></h3>

<p>2018-02-14</p>

<p>Scalzi universe is in a state of total war. The Colonial Union and Colonial Deference
Forces represent humanity in Universe and are looking to expand while in competition with
all other alien race who themselves are doing the same &ndash; except the Consu; the Consu are
badass. But the story itself focuses on the adventures of an individual, senior, recruit
who&rsquo;s tour of duty takes him to distance star systems to kill anything that isn&rsquo;t human.</p>

<p>Through a series of interesting events, Perry, our lead character, find himself in a
number of very interesting situations and meets many interesting some &ndash; some from a past
life as it happens.</p>

<p>The story itself was enjoyable and the twists added some suspense. It&rsquo;s not the most epic
of stories and some parts seem to go by rather quickly without any prolonged build up.
Regardless, a good read and gives the reader somethings to think about: our place in this
big universe, what it is to be human, and the nature of humanity.</p>

<h3 id="vonnegut-slaughterhouse-five">Vonnegut, <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em></h3>

<p>2018-02-15</p>

<p>I throughly enjoyed reading Slaughterhouse-Five. It is a wonderful mishmash the ordinary
and extraordinary elements of comedy, adventure and Sci-Fi rolled into a series of
time-warping events over the course of the characters life time.</p>

<p>Vonnegut brought comedy into the grim realities of war, all the while not taking anything
away from what war is. The inclusion of the Tralfamadorians bring another dimension &ndash;
literally &ndash; to the story.</p>

<p>The story is told in one of the most unique ways I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It&rsquo;s flashbacks taken to
a whole new level. You could be in a dark bedroom one moments and suddenly be walking
around in a European city circa WWII. But the flashbacks really help develop the story
and character. Some of the flashbacks help the reader better make sense of how the events
of the past can impact the distant future. The constant flipping between time frames also
mirrors the way the Tralfamadorians view time (for whom time is just another spacial
dimension). In a sense, the book seems to be told more from a Tralfamadorians point of
view than that of a human.</p>

<h3 id="foer-moon-walking-with-einstein">Foer, <em>Moon Walking with Einstein</em></h3>

<p>2018-02-14</p>

<p>Foer describes his 1 year journey as a journalist training in ancient techniques of
mnemonics. The unique prospective allows the reader to experience the steps one must go
through to go from novice to experiences in a brand new field.</p>

<p>The techniques listed are a introduction to a practice that was once held in high regard
in the world of antiquity. Although the book is far from a detailed guide, it does
present many techniques that can be applied with just a little practice to improve one&rsquo;s
own memory in everyday life. Josh&rsquo;s own experiences, as accounted in the story, also give
a summary of how he applied the new techniques and the way in which he was able to keep
improving his skills over the course of the year.</p>

<p>Currently midway through, but very engaging and insight book so far.</p>
